
Attacking
	-When you attack with a unit, a melee attack or ranged attack is performed depending on the weapon the unit attacks with.
	-Melee attack:
		-When you attack with an infantry unit, its Movement Points are reduced to 0.
			-Mounted units can move after attacking if they perform a charging strike.
		-The number of times a unit can attack in one turn depends on its speed.
			Speed:
			0 speed: 1 hit
			1-19 speed: 1-2 hits (more likely to do more hits if you have more speed)
			20-39 speed: 2-3 hits (more likely to do more hits if you have more speed)
			etc....
		-For each time that the unit attacks, do the following:
		-First roll for accuracy.
			-If roll 100 is lower than the Acc value, unit aims true (but may still not hit target).
			-Acc is the Accuracy w/ melee value of the attacker, since this is a melee attack.
		-Defender tries to parry.
			-If roll 100 is lower than defender's parry value, defender parries the attack.
			-If successful in parrying, defender tries to counter.
				-If roll 100 is lower than defender's counter value, defender counters.
				-When defender counters, he gets a free strike on the attacker that cannot miss.
				-Countering cuts the attacker's chain of attacks short, so they cannot attack again even if they would have because of their speed.
		-Defender's adjacent allies try to parry for him.
			-If defender unsuccessful in parrying, his allies may do the above step for him instead, and an adjacent ally may get off a free counter-attack.
		-Defender attempts to evade the attack.
			-If roll 100 is lower than defender's evasion value, defender evades and takes no damage.
			-If the attacker has more than 100 Accuracy, then before this roll is calculated, the defender's Eva value is modified:
				-(the attacker's Acc value - 100) is subtracted from the Eva value.
				-This Eva cut cannot cut the Eva value by more than half.
		-If none of the above occur, a strike is performed against the defender by the attacker.
		-A Strike works as follows:
		-First, the defender attempts to Block the strike.
			-First try to block with the offhand, then if that fails, with the mainhand.
			-If roll 100 is lower than defender's Block value, block is successful.
			-Block value is Block w/ melee, since this is a melee attack.
			-If block is successful, strike still occurs, but damage is reduced by the defender's blocking gear's defense values.
		-Defender's adjacent allies try to block for him.
		-Next a target body part is chosen:
			-Chance of hitting each body part is, for the most part, set.
			-10% arms, 10% legs, 5% head, remainder torso.
			-Exception: if unit is wearing no torso armour but is wearing armour on the arms, the chance of hitting the arms is increased by 250% (which also reduces chance to hit the torso)
		-Defense and protection values are taken from the body part that's targeted
		-Next the attacker attempts to perform a critical hit.
			-If roll 100 is lower than defender's Protection value, crit hit is performed.
			-Before this calculation, Protection value is reduced by the attacker's Crit value.
			-Successful crit. hits cut the defender's Defense values on the targeted body part in half.
		-Shock and pierce damage are taken from the attacker's weapon, and subtracted from the defender's Defense values.
			-Shock and pierce attack are added on to by general Attack value.
			-Shock and pierce defense are added on to by general Defense value.
		-Finally the defender takes damage based on the calculations above.
